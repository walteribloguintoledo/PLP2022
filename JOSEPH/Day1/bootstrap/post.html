            <p class="paragraph">
                A young high-school student awakens strapped to a chair across from a blind-folded man inside a room filled with talismans. The man, Satoru Gojo, asks the student, Yuji Itadori, which "one" he is now. Eventually, Yuji remembers someone named Fushiguro and shows concern for his senpai as well. However, Gojo reminds Yuji that he doesn't have time to be concerned with others because his "Secret Execution" has been set.</p>
            <p>The previous day, Yuji calls Sugisawa Hospital to check on his grandfather, but the old man demands that Yuji attend his club instead. The previous night, a student from Jujutsu Tech, Megumi Fushiguro, visits the grounds of Sugisawa High in hopes of finding a "cursed object". When he fails to do so, he calls Satoru Gojo, only to be told he can't return home until the object is recovered.</p>
            <p>At Yuji's club with Iguchi and Sasaki, the student council President threatens to close the Occult Club due to inactivity. To prove their research, they tell the President about their theory that something supernatural might be affecting the students on the rugby field. However, the President nullifies their argument by revealing ticks caused the player's illness. In addition, Yuji is registered to the Track and Field Team, not the Occult Club.</p>
            <p>Yuji Itadori, a normal high school student with incredible athleticism would rather hang out with his senpai in the Occult Club than run on the track. However, after losing his grandfather, Yuji's club comes face to face with the grim reality of curses. In order to save his friends, Yuji teams up with jujutsu student, Megumi Fushiguro, to exorcise the curses and recover the cursed object: Ryomen Sukuna.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Megumi states that he will exorcise Yuji as if he were a curse. However, Yuji raises his arms to signal that he means no harm and he's in control. He says they both need to get to a hospital, but Megumi can't tell if the curse is trying to trick him. Before he's forced to make a decision, Megumi's sensei, Satoru Gojo arrives.</p>
            <p>Megumi is surprised by his teacher's appearance so Gojo explains the elders were making a fuss about the cursed object. He stopped for souvenirs and then came to check on Megumi's progress. Yuji reveals that he ate the finger, which Gojo finds hard to believe. He examines Yuji closely and realizes that he actually has combined with Sukuna.</p>
            <p>Gojo decides to test Yuji's control by asking him to switch with Sukuna for ten seconds. In that time, Gojo will fight while Megumi holds his Kikufuku, a Sendai specialty. Megumi is taken back by his teacher's carelessness while Yuji allows Sukuna to take control. Despite the curse attacking first, Gojo is easily able to evade all of Sukuna's strikes with incredible speed.</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, Yuji is effortlessly able to regain control of his body. Gojo decides to knock him out and tells Megumi that if Yuji can awake as himself, he'll have real potential as a vessel. Megumi knows that Yuji should be executed under the rules of jujutsu, but Megumi asks his teacher not to allow that to happen. Gojo promises to fulfill this request and brings Yuji up to speed sometime later.</p>

            <div class="anime">Episode 3</div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The third first-year set to attend Jujutsu Tech arrives in Tokyo, fulfilling a dream she shared with a friend named Saori. Outside the train station in Harujuku, Yuji and Megumi wait to meet with her. Yuji wonders why their class is so small and also inquires about believing he was the third first-year to arrive that the school. Megumi explains the new student's acceptance was granted a while ago and jujutsu students are pretty rare.</p>
            <p>Gojo arrives and compliments Yuji on his new uniform, while also revealing that he custom ordered it with a hood. By the new girls request, they're set to meet in Harujuku. She notices a man scouting out models and angrily requests to be interviewed. Gojo calls out to her and she's freaked out by his strange blindfold. After putting her things in the coin locker she introduces herself as Nobara Kugisaki. She adds that the boys that are lucky to have her as the woman of their group.</p>
            <p>Yuji and Megumi introduce themselves but Nobara is completely unimpressed by both of them. Gojo claims they'll be taking a tour of Tokyo since they're all together for the first time. Yuji and Nobara expect an extravagant tour of Roppongi but Gojo brings them to an abandoned building close to a cemetery where a curse has taken over. Megumi explains how associating fear with cemeteries is how curses can be brought about, but Nobara interrupts to ask how it is that a jujutsu student doesn't already know this. She learns that Yuji swallowed Sukuna's finger and is grossed out by it.</p>
            <p>Gojo reveals this is a field test for Nobara and Yuji. Gojo gives Yuji a cursed tool, a knife called "Slaughter Demon", that has been imbued with cursed energy. He also restricts him from using Sukuna's power. Tasked with eliminating all the curses, Yuji and Nobara head inside the building together. Megumi wants to join but Gojo stops him and reveals that this test is for Nobara.</p>
