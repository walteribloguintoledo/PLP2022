                <p class="paragraph">
                    A young high-school student awakens strapped to a chair across from a blind-folded man inside a room
                    filled with talismans. The man, Satoru Gojo, asks the student, Yuji Itadori, which "one" he is now.
                    Eventually, Yuji remembers someone named Fushiguro and shows concern for his senpai as well.
                    However, Gojo reminds Yuji that he doesn't have time to be concerned with others because his "Secret
                    Execution" has been set.</p>
                <p>The previous day, Yuji calls Sugisawa Hospital to check on his grandfather, but the old man demands
                    that Yuji attend his club instead. The previous night, a student from Jujutsu Tech, Megumi
                    Fushiguro, visits the grounds of Sugisawa High in hopes of finding a "cursed object". When he fails
                    to do so, he calls Satoru Gojo, only to be told he can't return home until the object is recovered.
                </p>
                <p>At Yuji's club with Iguchi and Sasaki, the student council President threatens to close the Occult
                    Club due to inactivity. To prove their research, they tell the President about their theory that
                    something supernatural might be affecting the students on the rugby field. However, the President
                    nullifies their argument by revealing ticks caused the player's illness. In addition, Yuji is
                    registered to the Track and Field Team, not the Occult Club.</p>
                <p>Yuji Itadori, a normal high school student with incredible athleticism would rather hang out with his
                    senpai in the Occult Club than run on the track. However, after losing his grandfather, Yuji's club
                    comes face to face with the grim reality of curses. In order to save his friends, Yuji teams up with
                    jujutsu student, Megumi Fushiguro, to exorcise the curses and recover the cursed object: Ryomen
                    Sukuna.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Megumi states that he will exorcise Yuji as if he were a curse. However, Yuji raises his arms to
                    signal that he means no harm and he's in control. He says they both need to get to a hospital, but
                    Megumi can't tell if the curse is trying to trick him. Before he's forced to make a decision,
                    Megumi's sensei, Satoru Gojo arrives.</p>
                <p>Megumi is surprised by his teacher's appearance so Gojo explains the elders were making a fuss about
                    the cursed object. He stopped for souvenirs and then came to check on Megumi's progress. Yuji
                    reveals that he ate the finger, which Gojo finds hard to believe. He examines Yuji closely and
                    realizes that he actually has combined with Sukuna.</p>
                <p>Gojo decides to test Yuji's control by asking him to switch with Sukuna for ten seconds. In that
                    time, Gojo will fight while Megumi holds his Kikufuku, a Sendai specialty. Megumi is taken back by
                    his teacher's carelessness while Yuji allows Sukuna to take control. Despite the curse attacking
                    first, Gojo is easily able to evade all of Sukuna's strikes with incredible speed.</p>
                <p>Surprisingly, Yuji is effortlessly able to regain control of his body. Gojo decides to knock him out
                    and tells Megumi that if Yuji can awake as himself, he'll have real potential as a vessel. Megumi
                    knows that Yuji should be executed under the rules of jujutsu, but Megumi asks his teacher not to
                    allow that to happen. Gojo promises to fulfill this request and brings Yuji up to speed sometime
                    later.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The third first-year set to attend Jujutsu Tech arrives in Tokyo, fulfilling a dream she shared with
                    a friend named Saori. Outside the train station in Harujuku, Yuji and Megumi wait to meet with her.
                    Yuji wonders why their class is so small and also inquires about believing he was the third
                    first-year to arrive that the school. Megumi explains the new student's acceptance was granted a
                    while ago and jujutsu students are pretty rare.</p>
                <p>Gojo arrives and compliments Yuji on his new uniform, while also revealing that he custom ordered it
                    with a hood. By the new girls request, they're set to meet in Harujuku. She notices a man scouting
                    out models and angrily requests to be interviewed. Gojo calls out to her and she's freaked out by
                    his strange blindfold. After putting her things in the coin locker she introduces herself as Nobara
                    Kugisaki. She adds that the boys that are lucky to have her as the woman of their group.</p>
                <p>Yuji and Megumi introduce themselves but Nobara is completely unimpressed by both of them. Gojo
                    claims they'll be taking a tour of Tokyo since they're all together for the first time. Yuji and
                    Nobara expect an extravagant tour of Roppongi but Gojo brings them to an abandoned building close to
                    a cemetery where a curse has taken over. Megumi explains how associating fear with cemeteries is how
                    curses can be brought about, but Nobara interrupts to ask how it is that a jujutsu student doesn't
                    already know this. She learns that Yuji swallowed Sukuna's finger and is grossed out by it.</p>
                <p>Gojo reveals this is a field test for Nobara and Yuji. Gojo gives Yuji a cursed tool, a knife called
                    "Slaughter Demon", that has been imbued with cursed energy. He also restricts him from using
                    Sukuna's power. Tasked with eliminating all the curses, Yuji and Nobara head inside the building
                    together. Megumi wants to join but Gojo stops him and reveals that this test is for Nobara.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Kiyotaka Ijichi, the assistant manager at Tokyo Jujutsu High, brings first-years, Yuji Itadori,
                    Megumi Fushiguro, and Nobara Kugisaki to a detention center where windows have spotted a cursed
                    womb. Five detainees remain inside Detainee Block 2 with what could potentially spawn a special
                    grade cursed spirit. Confused, Yuji asks about the special grade, which Ijichi explains thoroughly.
                    He also warns them that if they end up encountering the special grade, their only options are to run
                    or die.</p>
                <p>Their mission is the confirmation and rescue of any survivors. A distraught mother of one of the
                    detainees asks that they please save her son, firing Yuji up. Yuji states to both his classmates
                    that they must save everyone, a notion to which they agree. Ijichi casts a Curtain, a barrier that
                    conceals them from the outside world. Megumi summons one of his Divine Dogs to warn them should any
                    curse approach.</p>
                <p>They head inside and Megumi is surprised to see they've entered a curse's Innate Domain. Yuji and
                    Nobara comically begin to panic but Megumi stays confident that his Divine Dog will smell any
                    threats. The trio moves out to find any humans trapped inside and eventually happen upon their
                    mutilated bodies. Amongst them, Yuji finds Tadashi, the son of the distressed woman. He wants to
                    bring their body back outside but Megumi refuses.</p>
                <p>Megumi points out that Tadashi is a detainee in this Juvenile Detention Center because he hit a
                    little girl on his second offense driving with a license. He acknowledges that Yuji is stuck on this
                    idea that he can guide people to proper deaths, but Megumi also proposes the question what happens
                    once someone he's saved hurts someone innocent. Yuji counters this by asking why is it that Megumi
                    saved him in the first place.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    While waiting outside the detention center, Megumi notices the cursed womb's Innate Domain has
                    disappeared. He believes that all he has to do is wait for Yuji, but Sukuna arrives to tell him that
                    won't be happening. In an uncharacteristically good mood, Sukuna blames Yuji for overusing his power
                    without a pact. He tells Megumi that Yuji can't switch back just yet and in order to prevent him
                    from taking back control, Sukuna rips out Yuji's heart.</p>
                <p>Sukuna effectively takes Yuji hostage now that switching back means death. In addition, Sukuna eats
                    another one of his fingers to strengthen his control. He prepares to kill Megumi and Sukuna admits
                    it's for no particular reason. Megumi sees the irony in the situation and believes he and Yuji's
                    positions are switched since when they first met.</p>
                <p>Megumi believes the only thing fair in the world is that the world is unfair to everyone. He tells
                    Sukuna that Yuji will switch back even if it means taking his own life. However, Sukuna argues that
                    Yuji is a coward who was just crying inside when he was fighting against the special grade. Megumi
                    ignores him and notices that Sukuna can use a Reverse Cursed Technique. He plans on fighting Sukuna,
                    believing that he's at a disadvantage without a heart and can be forced to heal.</p>
                <p>Megumi begins by summoning Nue and engaging Sukuna at close range. Sukuna simply toys with him until
                    Megumi unleashes Orochi and lifts him into the air where Nue can strike repeatedly. However, Sukuna
                    destroys Great Serpent and uses the open space to throw Megumi around using power and agility.
                    Without even using jujutsu, Sukuna overpowers Megumi and he's forced to release Nue.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Thought to be dead, within Yuji's corpse his mind still exists within Sukuna Innate Domain. Pleased
                    with himself, Sukuna sits atop a mountain of skulls and tells the brat not to look up at him without
                    permission. Irritated, Yuji simply replies that Sukuna should come down so he can look down on him.
                    Sukuna feels like Yuji is being hostile which is obviously due to the fact that the curse
                    essentially killed him. Yuji believes they're in the afterlife and is determined to punish Sukuna.
                </p>
                <p>Yuji begins fighting against Sukuna but is quickly overwhelmed. Sukuna explains that this is not the
                    afterlife and they're still in a suspended state of existence within Sukuna's mind. He wants to
                    strike a deal with Yuji to fix his heart and asks for two conditions. The first being that he can
                    use Yuji's body for a minute after using a key phrase and the second is that Yuji forgets this
                    conversation. Yuji refuses to lend his body ever again, but Sukuna promises not to hurt anyone
                    within that minute. Even so, Yuji doesn't believe Sukuna will uphold his side of the bargain.</p>
                <p>Sukuna explains that a pact made with jujutsu cannot be broken or else Sukuna will be punished. It is
                    because Yuji tried to use Sukuna's power without a Binding Vow while the curse was unwilling. Yuji
                    stubbornly refuses Sukuna and punches him, demanding he be brought back to life without conditions.
                    They both agree to fight to the death in order to determine who gets their way, and Sukuna instantly
                    bisects Yuji's head.</p>
                <p>Still irritated by Yuji's demise, Gojo vents to Ijichi. Gojo recognizes he has a bad attitude and
                    being a teacher isn't exactly his style. However, in order to change the broken foundations of the
                    jujutsu community, he will need to raise sorcerers with his progressive ideals. Additionally he
                    wants to train strong allies to fight alongside him against curses in the future. He believes
                    students like Okkotsu and Hakari have enough potential to match his own strength. Yuji was another
                    student with potential, so Gojo feels this loss especially.</p>

                    While on their way to meet with the principal, Gojo detects a disturbance and asks the driver to
                    stop the car. Confused, Ijichi stops the vehicle and lets Gojo out in the middle of the road while
                    asking if this is some kind of test. Gojo refutes this idea and makes Ijichi drive off, preparing
                    for the disturbance to reach him any moment. Right on cue, Jogo appears above the sorcerer and
                    attempts to crush him.</p>
                <p>Gojo avoids the cursed spirit as he crashes into the road, cracking the pavement. He asks who this
                    curse is but Jogo responds by creating a volcano head that blasts Gojo with a magma explosion from
                    behind. Jogo believes that the deed is done, but the strongest sorcerer warns him not to write him
                    off as he wipes away the ash and lava from his forcefield.</p>
                <p>Gojo is surprised to meet a curse that can communicate clearly and believes that in terms of his
                    sheer amount of cursed energy Jogo surpasses Sukuna at his current level, meaning he's an
                    unregistered special grade. He tells Jogo that special grades can't keep popping up or it ruins the
                    meaning of the rank. The cursed spirit suggests that Gojo is losing heart, but on the contrary
                    things are just starting to get fun for the sorcerer.</p>
                <p>Jogo chose a place to fight that was devoid of people to avoid sorcerer's backing up Gojo. He uses
                    Ember Insects to attack the sorcerer but Gojo stops them in their tracks. The insects use sound to
                    explode, which Gojo avoids but the volcanic cursed spirit acts quickly to strike the sorcerer with
                    two more flaming attacks. Once again, Jogo considers himself the victor too early when in reality
                    his attacks have had no effects at all.</p>

                    Somewhere on Tokyo Jujutsu High grounds, Megumi and Nobara are running errands for Maki. Panda is
                    concerned about the meeting with Kyoto's principal. Maki doesn't believe the principal will pull
                    anything in the middle of the day but that's not quite what Panda is worried about. It's likely that
                    students may have come with him, because they love to talk trash.</p>
                <p>Aoi Todo and Mai Zenin arrive to confront Megumi and Nobara. They came with the principal and Mai
                    claims they're checking on them since their classmate died. Mai taunts them by mocking their dead
                    friend, annoying both first years. Aoi is completely uninterested in this and claims he only came to
                    confirm that Yuta Okkotsu's replacements will be entertaining.</p>
                <p>Aoi asks what kind of girls he likes and claims depending on the answer that he'll beat him half to
                    death. He declares that his type of woman is tall with a big butt. Megumi doesn't want to discuss
                    his taste in women with a man he just met and Nobara adds that it's too hard for an antisocial like
                    him. Aoi believes that a person's taste in women says everything about them. If they having boring
                    tastes, then they're boring people and Aoi does not like boring people.</p>
                <p>The Goodwill Event is something Aoi looks forward to and he can't accept that it might be boring. He
                    demands an answer and Megumi tells him that an unshakable character is all he requires from a
                    potential partner. He wants to avoid confrontation but Aoi is unsatisfied with this answer. He tells
                    Megumi that he's boring and immediately attacks him.</p>

                    At Satozakura High School, a young student named Junpei Yoshino is being bullied by his peers.
                    Apparently they believe he was staring at their girlfriend's chest. Junpei wouldn't press a button
                    that would make everyone he hates die, but he would press one that kills everyone who hates him
                    without hesitation.</p>
                <p>Sometime later, Junpei skips school to see Human Earthworm 3, a movie, at the theater. Unfortunately
                    for him, his school bullies also happen to be attending the movie. This makes him recall how when
                    they bullied him for looking at Tsubasa's chest. She's only using them for attention and they only
                    listen because they want to hook up with her. When he points this out, the bullies beat him harder.
                </p>
                <p>The bullies at the theater are eventually killed by the cursed spirit, Mahito, for making too much
                    noise in the theater. Junpei walks up to investigate their grotesque corpses and leaves the theater
                    to track down Mahito. Junpei confronts him in an alleyway, believing there is no way he could be
                    human. When he catches up, Junpei asks Mahito if there was any way he could do the things that he
                    does.</p>
                <p>The authorities leave the scene to jujutsu sorcerers. Yuji Itadori and Grade 1 sorcerer Kento Nanami
                    investigate the corpses. Nanami points out the residuals left behind from the cursed technique that
                    distorted the bodies. Yuji takes a moment and learns to see them after focusing, but Nanami doesn't
                    praise him for it. The student suggests they go all out but Nanami argues moderate effort will
                    suffice, making Yuji feel like they're getting along so far.</p>

                    Junpei Yoshino used to run the movie club at Satozakura High School with a few likeminded friends.
                    They're interrupted by a few bullies who claim to be using the room for themselves. They demand
                    everyone leaves, but Junpei wants one of his DVDs first. This irritates one of the students, who
                    decides to start beating Junpei. The other kids run away scared while Shota Ito and other bullies
                    decide to join in on the beating.</p>
                <p>In the present, Junpei speaks with Mahito about Japanese wordplay regarding the popular phrase the
                    "opposite of love is indifference." Mahito shows Junpei a few of his experiments. Using his cursed
                    technique, he can change people's forms. He decides to show Junpei how large and small he can make
                    human bodies.</p>
                <p>To his surprise, Junpei isn't shocked because he already knows how repulsive human begins can be.
                    Mahito explains that people have souls at their core, not metaphorical "hearts". He believes there
                    is no value or purpose to life because life is a just a continuous cycle. Mahito believes Junpei
                    doesn't need to quell his hatred because the two of them can do whatever they want.</p>
                <p>After Junpei leaves, he's spotted by Ijichi and Yuji as they drive slowly behind him. Yuji learns his
                    classmates are doing well and receives his assignment. He must use weak cursed spirits known as Fly
                    Heads to test his talent for jujutsu and his possible connection to the theater incident. At the
                    same time, Nanami enters Mahito's underground lair, claiming he doesn't take pleasure in killing
                    humans if they are mutated and beyond saving.</p>
